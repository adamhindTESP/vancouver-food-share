# 🍅 Vancouver Food Share

A lightweight, community-run directory template for public food sharing locations.

This project provides a simple **static web page** that helps people:
- discover **public food-sharing locations** in a city,
- optionally share when they’ve dropped food,
- set realistic expectations about availability,
- and support local hosts without overpromising or creating harm.

It was designed with care to be:
- respectful of people’s time,
- safe for donors, recipients, and hosts,
- easy to reuse in other communities,
- and free/open-source.

> **Important:** This is *not* a real-time inventory tracker.  
> It only shows activity that community members choose to share.

## 🚀 Why this exists

Community fridges and public food shares are a great resource — but often:
- food disappears within minutes of being dropped,
- people travel long distances only to find nothing left,
- donation guidelines differ by location,
- and there’s no safe, simple way to share patterns without creating false expectations.

This directory helps by:
- putting locations on a single page,
- making donation guidelines discoverable,
- and making it easy for donors to share *optional* activity signals.

No guarantees are made about availability.

## 🛠 How it works

The site is completely static (no server). It runs as a plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript page that you can host anywhere.

Users can:
- view public food-sharing locations,
- optionally report that they dropped food (no item details),
- read donation guidelines (provided by hosts),
- and see gentle wording that makes no promises about availability.

## 🧠 Configurable content

You will find all the display text and locations directly in the HTML.  
There’s no hidden data store — everything is transparent and editable.

You can make it yours by replacing:
- city name
- addresses
- labels
- donation guideline links
- contact email

If you want to translate the text to another language, simply edit the strings in the HTML.
