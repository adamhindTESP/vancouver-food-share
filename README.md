# 🍅 Vancouver Food Share

A **lightweight, community‑run web directory** for public food‑sharing locations.  
Designed to be easily adapted for any city, language, or community network.

---

## 🌍 Overview

This project provides a simple **single‑page static web app** to help people:

- Discover **public food‑sharing and community fridge** locations.  
- Optionally share when they’ve dropped food (no item tracking).  
- Understand expected availability to prevent wasted trips.  
- Support local hosts safely, without overpromising or creating harm.

Built for dignity, clarity, and simplicity — not for data collection or scaling for profit.

> **Note:** This is *not* a live inventory tracker.  
> It only displays **community‑submitted activity patterns** when people choose to share them.

## 🚀 Purpose

Community fridges and food‑sharing spaces are powerful, but they face universal challenges:

- Food is often claimed within minutes.  
- Visitors travel only to find fridges empty.  
- Donation rules differ by location.  
- Most tools overcomplicate something that should stay local and human.

This project offers a calm alternative — a **self‑contained directory template** that helps people:

- List public food‑sharing locations in one place.  
- Display donation guidelines and host details clearly.  
- Encourage optional, low‑pressure community reporting.

No promises. No tracking. Just shared awareness.

## 🛠 How It Works

This is a **fully static site** (just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).  
It runs in any browser and can be hosted anywhere, such as **GitHub Pages**.

Visitors can:

- Browse local food‑sharing locations.  
- Optionally report when they’ve dropped food.  
- Read guidelines provided by local hosts.  
- See clear, respectful language about availability.

There is **no backend**, **no database**, and **no login required**.
