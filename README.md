# Vancouver Food Share

A lightweight, community-run web directory for public food-sharing locations.  
Designed to be easily adapted for any city, language, or community network.

***

## 🌍 Overview

Vancouver Food Share is a single-page, **static web app** that helps people:

- Find public food-sharing and community fridge locations
- Learn where food is welcome — and under what guidelines  
- Avoid wasted trips by setting honest expectations
- Support hosts and volunteers without pressure or over-demand

**Built for dignity, clarity, and simplicity** — not for data collection, optimization, or growth at any cost.

> **Important**: This is **not** a live inventory system. It never guarantees food availability and never tracks items. At most, it may show optional, community-shared activity patterns to help set expectations.

***

## 🤝 Relationship to Existing Food Networks

This project **supports and amplifies** existing community food-sharing efforts, not replaces them.

**Works best alongside**:
- Community fridges
- Food rescue and redistribution organizations
- Volunteer-run pantry networks  
- Mutual aid and neighborhood sharing initiatives

**If a city already has an established organization or directory**, this tool can:
- Point people toward it
- Reduce confusion about where food is appropriate to drop
- Help new hosts feel comfortable participating
- Lighten the burden on organizers by clarifying expectations

**Nothing about how organizations operate needs to change.**  
This tool adapts to communities — not the other way around.

***

## 🚀 Purpose

Community food-sharing spaces are powerful, but face universal challenges:

- Food is often claimed within **minutes**
- Visitors travel only to find fridges **empty**
- Rules differ by **location and host**
- Many tools **overcomplicate** something that should remain local and human

This project offers a **calm alternative** — a self-contained directory template that helps people:

- See where food is being shared publicly
- Understand donation guidelines **before arriving**
- Share awareness **without creating obligation**

**No promises. No optimization. Just shared awareness** that lowers hesitation and invites generosity.

***

## 🛠 How It Works

**Fully static website** built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Runs in any browser. Host anywhere, including GitHub Pages.

**Visitors can**:
- Browse local food-sharing locations
- Read host-provided guidelines
- Optionally share they've dropped food (**no details required**)
- See clear, respectful language about availability

**There is**:
- ❌ **No backend**
- ❌ **No database**  
- ❌ **No accounts or logins**

**Goal**: Not precision — **lowering hesitation**. Helping people with extra food feel confident about where it can be shared.
