🛠 How to Launch This in Your City
This project is a "Single-File App." That means everything—the design, the logic, and the content—lives inside one single file (index.html). You don't need a database, a server, or a budget to get this running for your community.
1. Get the Code
• The Manual Way: Create a new file on your computer named index.html. Open the code from this project, copy everything, and paste it into your new file.
• The GitHub Way: If you have a GitHub account, simply "Fork" this repository to create your own copy.
2. Customize the Local Details
Open your index.html file in a text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code) and search for these sections to make it yours:
• City Name: Find <h1>🍅 Vancouver Food Share</h1> and change "Vancouver" to your city.
• Location List: Look for the <ul> section under ``. Update the names and addresses.
• Example: Change Kitsilano Fridge to [Your Neighborhood] Pantry.
• Contact Email: Search for adam.hind005@gmail.com and replace it with your own contact email so local hosts can reach you.
• Drop-off Options: Ensure the <select> options in the `` section match the names of the locations you listed above.
3. Translate (Optional)
Because all the text is in plain English within the HTML tags (like <p>, <h2>, and <span>), you can easily translate the site into any language.

Pro-Tip: You can paste the entire code into an AI like Gemini and say: "Translate all the user-facing text in this code to Spanish (or any language) and change the city to Madrid." It will give you back a fully translated, ready-to-go file.

4. Verify Your Spots
Before you go live, physically verify the locations. Ensure they are:
• Publicly Accessible: Can someone reach it without a key or a special invite?
• Safe: Is the area well-lit and the fridge/pantry in good repair?
• Accurate: Check that the address in your code leads exactly to the fridge, especially if it's tucked in an alleyway.
5. Host it for Free
You can host this site for $0 using GitHub Pages:
1. Upload your edited index.html to a public GitHub repository.
2. Go to Settings > Pages.
3. Under Branch, select main and click Save.
4. Your site will be live at https://[your-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]/.
6. The "Quiet Invitation" Launch
This project works best when it grows through trust, not ads.
• Print QR Codes: Put a small flyer on the fridges themselves with a QR code linking to your site.
• Share with Mutual Aid Groups: Send the link to local Discord, Slack, or Facebook groups dedicated to community care.
• Keep it Lightweight: Don't worry about "inventory." Remind people that the goal is simply to show activity patterns, not to promise a full fridge.
