# 🛠 How to Launch This in Your City

This project is a **Single‑File App** — everything (design, logic, and content) lives in one file: `index.html`.  
You don’t need a database, a server, or a budget to get this running for your community.

---

## 1. Get the Code

**• The Manual Way:**  
Create a new file on your computer named `index.html`.  
Open the code from this project, copy everything, and paste it into your new file.

**• The GitHub Way:**  
If you have a GitHub account, simply **Fork** this repository to create your own copy.

---

## 2. Customize the Local Details

Open your `index.html` file in a text editor (like **VS Code**, **Notepad**, or **TextEdit**) and update a few key parts.

| What to Change | Where to Find It | What to Do |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **City Name** | `<h1>🍅 Vancouver Food Share</h1>` | Change “Vancouver” to your city. |
| **Location List** | the `<ul>` section under “📍 Community Food‑Sharing Locations” | Replace the sample fridges (e.g. *Kitsilano Fridge*) with your local spots. |
| **Contact Email** | `adam.hind005@gmail.com` | Replace with your own email for host inquiries. |
| **Drop‑off Options** | the `<select>` list in the “Share a Food Drop” form | Ensure the options match your updated location names. |

## 3. Translate (Optional)

All text is written directly in plain English within HTML tags, so you can easily translate the page yourself.

**Pro Tip:**  
You can paste the entire code into an AI (like Gemini or ChatGPT) and say:

> “Translate all the user‑facing text to Spanish and change the city to Madrid.”

It will return a fully translated, ready‑to‑use file — no extra setup needed.

---

## 4. Verify Your Spots

Before sharing your site publicly, confirm that every listed location is valid and safe.

- ✅ **Publicly Accessible:** Can anyone reach it without keys or invitations?  
- ✅ **Safe:** Is the space clean, well‑lit, and fridge/pantry in good condition?  
- ✅ **Accurate:** Double‑check that the address leads directly to the correct location (especially for alley spots).

## 5. Host It for Free

You can host this site for **$0** using **GitHub Pages**:

1. Upload your edited `index.html` to a **public GitHub repository**.  
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.  
3. Under **Branch**, select `main`, then click **Save**.  
4. Your site will be live at:

https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/

## 6. The “Quiet Invitation” Launch

This project grows best through community trust — not ads.

- 🖨 **Print QR Codes:** Place small flyers on fridges or pantries with a QR code linking to your site.  
- 🤝 **Share with Local Groups:** Post your link in mutual aid Discords, Slack spaces, or Facebook groups.  
- 🕊 **Keep It Light:** No inventory or sign‑ups — just help people see where food is moving.

---

## 📎 QR Codes (Optional)

Many communities print **QR codes** linking to their local pages and place them near fridges or drop‑off points.  
Each city generates its own QR code using its **unique local website URL**.

Example tools: [qr-code-generator.com](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) or [qr.io](https://qr.io/).
